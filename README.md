ETL Project: Mobile Number Validation and Name Uppercasing
Overview
This ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project showcases a powerful combination of data manipulation using Python. The primary objectives are to validate mobile numbers and convert names to uppercase within a dataset. This can be particularly useful for data cleaning and standardization tasks.

Project Details:

Extract:
The project begins with data extraction from a source, which could be in various formats such as CSV, Excel, or a database.

Transform:
Mobile Number Validation (Python): Python is used to validate mobile numbers within the dataset. It checks for valid formats and ensures consistency.
Name Uppercasing (Python): Python is employed to convert names to uppercase, helping maintain uniformity and consistency.

Load:
After the transformation phase, the cleaned and standardized data can be loaded back into the source or into a new destination, depending on your requirements.

How to Use:
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Prepare your dataset in the desired format (CSV, Excel, etc.) and place it in the project folder.
Modify the Python and R scripts to suit your dataset's structure and requirements.
Run the Python script for mobile number validation and the R script for name uppercase conversion.
Review the transformed data for accuracy and consistency.
Load the cleaned data as needed.
